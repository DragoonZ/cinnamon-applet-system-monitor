## Reporting an Issue
If you want to report a bug or want to make a feature request, please do following:

1. Look if this is resolved in the latest [version](https://github.com/pixunil/cinnamon-applet-system-monitor/releases) or HEAD (see [Installation](https://github.com/pixunil/cinnamon-applet-system-monitor/blob/master/README.md#installation))
2. Look if it is already [reported](https://github.com/pixunil/cinnamon-applet-system-monitor/issues?q=is%3Aissue), else open a new one
3. If it is a bug, attach the contents of `~/.xsession-errors` and `~/.cinnamon/glass.log`, wrapped into [code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines)
4. Add a nice description

I will now look how I can solve this or how a new feature can be implemented.

Thanks for your help!
